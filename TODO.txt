So basically there is an issue where all of the methods in menu.cpp are using the player class definition from that file
while the functions in the guessing game file are using the class definition for player from  the header file. I'm not sure 
if that is actually the problem, but thats what it seems like. My way of fixing this is going to be moving methods that dont
need to be in the player class outside of the player class. This will include taking stuff like pickUser() makeUser() and fileConv() 
out of the class. This will cause some issues, but it generally should be fine. I also need to reorganize some of the recusive looping
stuff so looks a little nicer. I also need to change some of the if statements to switch cases. Most of them are fine, but some 
of the if statement strings should be looked at again

so:
- Move methods that font need to be in the class out of it
- reorganize recusive loops 
- if statements to switch cases

I finsihed establishing the player class, but I'm realizing now that I need to declare it in the header then define it in the source file
this will allow the other files to access the same Player class, which is the issue I'm currently having with the gameLoop right now. I 
need to figure out how to put the constructors in there though, I dont know if I cna just put them in as is, or if I will need to just 
put the decleration then define it in the source like the others or if there is a special case.

so:
- move class decleration and methods into header file
- figure out constructor decleration/definition
- adjust guessing game file to work with this

Implemented changes in menu to gameLoop. I also litterally just coppyied the playerclass into the menu header file, this didn't break anything
in the menu file, so I think everything is fine, but I guess we'll see when I gifure out how to compile.

so:
- figure out how to compile with multiple files
- check the logic of everything so I can try to reduce confusion prior to compiling

It almost compiles, it says the function yesCheck(string input) is declared multiple times in main.cpp, but it isnt even defined in that file so
I'm not sure what the issue is. That is the only error left though (unless yesCheck() causes errors), so after I get that wokring it should compile.

so:
- get yesCheck() to work properly

The reason it wouldnt compile is I had the yesCheck mehod defined in the header instead of the source file, I don't know why i didnt assume that was
the issue, but its done now so who cares.

Got everything working as intended, still need to test creating new users, but that worked before so I'm assuming it still works, it should still be 
tested though. Now I need to move onto the other games, I'll probably do slots -> blackjac -> roullete, then maybe poker if I can figure out server 
stuff, or end up deciding to just do it locally. Nonethe less the infastructure is made to do everything, all that really needs to be done is to 
create the other game loops, and rename the current one to be more concise.

so:
- test creating new user
- rename gameLoop to be more concise
- make other game loops

- potentially figure out server stuff for multiplayer games (Poker, blackjack, and maybe even roullete)
