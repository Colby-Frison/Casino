So basically there is an issue where all of the methods in menu.cpp are using the player class definition from that file
while the functions in the guessing game file are using the class definition for player from  the header file. I'm not sure 
if that is actually the problem, but thats what it seems like. My way of fixing this is going to be moving methods that dont
need to be in the player class outside of the player class. This will include taking stuff like pickUser() makeUser() and fileConv() 
out of the class. This will cause some issues, but it generally should be fine. I also need to reorganize some of the recusive looping
stuff so looks a little nicer. I also need to change some of the if statements to switch cases. Most of them are fine, but some 
of the if statement strings should be looked at again

so:
- Move methods that font need to be in the class out of it
- reorganize recusive loops 
- if statements to switch cases
